%% Part 1
% Answer some questions here in these comments...
% How accurate is the model for the first portion of the minute? 

%The first portion of the first minute is very accurate until about t = 30
%seconds. At this point, our modeled data vears off from the measured data.
%One reason is since our modeled data does not include air resistance,
%Felix does not hit terminal velocity, so our data will be inaccurate in that section.

% How accurate is the model for the last portion of that first minute? 

%The last portion of the first minute is not as accurate as the first
%portion. As I said above, a reason could be because our modeled data does
%not hit terminal velocity like the measured data because our modeled data
%does not include air resistance.

% Comment on the acceleration calculated from the measured data. 
% Is there any way to smooth the acceleration calculated from the data?

%Our acceleration calculated from the measured data at any point can jump
%between a range of 10ms^-2, meaning that the maximum spike in our graph is
%a 10ms^-2 jump. To lessen this error. one way of smoothing the graph is 
%to gather more data points. With more data points in a given time interval,
%the acceleration data points will be closer to its successor resulting in
%a smoother graph. There is also a smooth function in Matlabs which we took 
%advantage of to clean up our acceleration graph.

% Answer some questions here in these comments...
% Estimate your uncertainty in the mass that you have chosen (at the 
%     beginning of the jump). 

% Based on our online research, we chose Felix's total mass to be 118Kg to
% be a good estimate. However, based on our online research, we found a
% good estimate for the minimum range of his mass to be about 100Kg and the
% maximum to be 130Kg. This gives our estimate of 118Kg an error bound of
% about +/- 15Kg

% How sensitive is the velocity and altitude reached after 60 seconds to 
%    changes in the chosen mass?

%After 60 seconds, Felix would have already hit terminal velocity. Terminal
%velocity is dependant on many factors, one of them being mass. Since
%terminal velocity depends on mass, altitude does aswell. However, when
%running our graph with m = 100 instead of m = 118. The changes in the
%velocity and altitude are insignificant and almost unoticable, therefore 
%we see that the graph is not very sensitive to an 18Kg mass change.

%% Part 3
% Answer some questions here in these comments...
% Felix was wearing a pressure suit and carrying oxygen. Why? 
% What can we say about the density of air in the stratosphere?
% How is the density of air different at around 39,000 meters than it 
% is on the ground?

%Felix wore a full body pressure suit that acted as his life support
%system, providing protection from temperatures of 100 degrees to -90
%degrees F. At very high altitudes, the suit maintains a constant and safe
%pressure from the extreme low pressure of the atmosphere at that height.He
%was carrying oxygen because as altitude increases, the concentration of
%oxygen decreases. The air density at sea level is 1.225kg/m^3 whil the air
%density at the stratosphere and upwards is near 0, therefore the drag due
%to air resistance increases closer to the ground. 

% What are the factors involved in calculating the density of air? 
% How do those factors change when we end up at the ground but start 
% at the stratosphere?  Please explain how calculating air density up 
% to the stratosphere is more complicated than say just in the troposphere.

%The main factors that determine air density is temperature, pressure,
%altitude, and humidity. At sea level, the air density is much greater,
%temperature is warmer and pressure is much greater compared to the stratosphere. The reason calculating
%The air density at the stratosphere is more complicated than calculating the
%density at the troposphere because in the stratosphere, there are 3
%layers to consider the upper stratosphere, lowerstratosphere, and
%stratospause. Which is more complicated than calculating the 
%2 layers in the troposphere (troposphere and tropopause) 


% What method(s) can we employ to estimate [the ACd] product? 

%To estimate the ACd product, we found the ACd product by finding his maximum speed,
% then finding his height and air density at that maximum speed, after we
% derived the formula ACd = 2*Fg/(rho*velocity^2) and solved for ACd
% What is your estimated [ACd] product?
% the result was 0.588

%[Given what we are told in the textbook about the simple drag constant, b,] 
% does the estimate for ACd seem reasonable?

% No, 0.2 is almost 3x less than what the coef. of drag should be for a human in
% freefall. Also, our estimate of 0.588 a an underestimate because we did not
% account for the area of his suit.

%% Part 4
% Answer some questions here in these comments...
% What is the actual gravitational field strength around 39,000 meters? 
%   (See Tipler Volume 1 6e page 369.) 
% -9.69ms^-2
% How sensitive is the altitude reached after 4.5 minutes to simpler and 
% more complicated ways of modelling the gravitational field strength? 

%The actual gravitatational field strength at 39,000 meters is
%approximately -9.69ms^-2. Felix was at a height of 2400 meters above the
%Earth's surface 4.5 minutes into the jump. The gravitational field
%strength at this height compared to the strength at the Earth's surface
%differs by less than 0.01ms^-2, therefore implying that the method we use
%to compute the gravitational field strength does not matter and is 
%insignificant because the error is very small.  

% What other changes could we make to our model? Refer to, or at least 
% attempt to explain, the physics behind any changes that you propose. 

%One change we could factor into our model ito make it more accurate is 
%to find out Felix's horizontal component of velocity during the fall. 
%With unpredictable wind patterns etc., Felix would
%not have fallen straight down from his jump position in the atmosphere,
%but instead a considerable distance away from the position directly
%below his platform. Factoring this in would impact our graphs greatly
%because with his horizontal component of velocity the total time to fall
%would have been longer than if he just fell straight down. 


% What is a change that we could make to our model that would result in 
% insignificant changes to the altitude reached after 4.5 minutes? 


%After 4.5 minutes, a change we could make in our model that would make a 
%insignificant change is wether we used just -9.80ms^-2 or used the
%general formula -GMm/r^2 to calculate field strength because 2000 meters
%above the Earth's surface is negligible to the size of Earth's radius.

% How can we decide what change is significant and what change is 
%   insignificant?


%The total distance Felix fell is about 39,000 meters. This implies that
%any change that would be significant to the model would have to change
%significantly from 6.38*10^6 meters(Earth's radius) to 6.38*10^6 + 39,000
%meters(his jump height). Examples are air pressure, air density and
%temperature.



% [What changes did you try out to improve the model?  (Show us your changes
%   even if they didn't make the improvement you hoped for.)]
% <put your answer here in these comments>

%We tried different masses, change in gravity(using the gravitational force
%instead of a constant for g), and different cross sectional areas for Felix.

%% Part 5
% Answer some questions here in these comments...
% At what altitude does Felix pull the ripcord to deploy his parachute? 

%approximately 2550 meters above Earth's sea level

% Recalculate the ACd product with the parachute open, and modify your 
%   code so that you use one ACd product before and one after this altitude. 
%   According to this version of the model, what is the maximum magnitude 
%   of acceleration that Felix experiences? 

%From our acceleration graph, we observe that the maximum change in
%acceleration that Felix experiences, is about 200ms^-2. 

%   How safe or unsafe would such an acceleration be for Felix?

%Felix experienced a change in acceleration of about 200ms^-2 which is
%about 20G's. To put this in perspective, a lethal car accident ranges from
%30 to 60 G's of Force. From this information, we can see that 20G's is not
%lethal, but also not good for the body. the acceleration was safe enough
%for him to survive.
